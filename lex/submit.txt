Handling Comments:

Handling Errors:
Errors are caught at the end of the lexer by anything that is not previously caught.
An error message is returned and gives the line number and position of the illegal character.
A LexerException is raised once an illegal character is reached. The exception is given the line and column number of the illegal character. 
We maintained the line number with a global variable that was incremented anytime a \n was encountered.
The column position is kept in a global list and uses an offset from the yypos value.

Handling the EOF:
If a comment is not closed and EOF is reached a LexerException is thrown with the line and column number. Comment nesting is handled by a global variable. It is incremented whenever a new comment is opened and decremented when a comment is closed.
