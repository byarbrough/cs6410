Handling Comments:

Handling Errors:
Errors are caught at the end of the lexer by anything that is not previously caught.
The printed error message gives the line number and position of the illegal character.
We maintained the line number with a global variable that was incremented anytime a \n was encountered.
The column position is kept in a global list and uses an offset from the yypos value.
