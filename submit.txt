Final Submission!


To run this tiger compiler use the included makefile.
Simply use:

make TARGET=foo.tig

where foo.tig is the tiger file you wish to compile.

This will output an executable assembly file named
foo.tig.s that can be run with SPIM or your MIPS
emulator of choice.

Unfortunately, we were unable to resolve a bug with
label placement in register allocation. As a result,
the final program does not successfully compile.
Aside from this, to the best of our knowledge,
things should be working properly.

In order to keep things from crashing and allow
as much compilation as possible, the lines in main
that call register allocation have been commented out.
To observe the marvelous fail, uncomment lines 
29 and 32 in main.sml or instructionSelection/main.sml
depedning on which directory you are in.

While many of the bugs found in previous submissions
have been resolved, there are some that linger.
