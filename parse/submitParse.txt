Many of the shift/reduce conflicts were hanled by precedence rules.
Precedence for the operators was explicitily outlined by Apel, such TIMES binding more tightly than PLUS. He also lists precedence for Boolean operations. Simply listing these in and giving them associativity eliminated many of the conflicts.
We had to think a little bit more carefully about the shift/reduce conflict with IF THEN and IF THEN ELSE.
This was also handled by precedence: right associative ELSE binds more tightly than ASSIGN, THEN, DO, or OF but less tightly than all the other operators.
This is the correct approach because in the case of

if a then if b then s1 else s2

The desired outcome is 

if a then { if b then s1 else s2 }.

Binding ELSE more tightly than THEN accomplishes this.

The ASSIGN, THEN, DO, and OF prcedence rules make it so that Assignments are given least priority in the case of exps that have ambigious parsing (like the OpExps). The precedence makes it so that the largest expression is used when in the body of a loop, with a IF statement, or with assignment. 

The most signifigant challenge we faced was with the the conflict between the two rules 

lvalue: ID LBRACK exp RBRACK

and

array: ID LBRACK exp RBRACK OF exp.

In order to fix it, we added a rule to lvalue, identical to the first. The language that the rule accepts is a subset another lvalue rule ( lvalue LBRACK exp RBRACK ), but it allows the parser to wait until more information is available before deciding if should shift (for the array) or reduce (for an lvalue). Without this rule it has to choose to shift (array) or reduce (lvalue) when it parses the ID.
